My issues with JIRA

## Notifications
Notification system uses email more absuively than the worst free to play app on mobile. 

Overflow in number of notifications, often more than 30 notifications in one day.

Notifications are, for the most part, useless and are hard to understand.

## Kanban board small window hell
Kanban board view looks very bad on less than full screen.

Hiding the ticket details is possible. Unfortunetly once you click a ticket to drag it. The details pop back out bigger and more intrusive.

## Create issue

Create issue is slow.

There is always a "CREATE" botton hovering on top, which I should persume always creates and issue.

## Create issue #2

Creating issue shoves the issue to backlog. Forcing one to go to the backlog, dig the issue, drag it back to current. Than switch to kanban board and begin working.

## Moving a ticket 

Results in a block UI with wait of 1-2 seconds for each action.

## responsiveness

The system does not respond, sometimes waiting more than 1-2 seconds for every single click and action.

## Board random behaviour

Clicking on the Web board randomely opens either the kanban view or the backlog view
